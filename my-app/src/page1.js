            A paragraph is defined as “a group of sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long.

            1. I hope you know how much you mean to me. You are my world, and I would do anything for you. You are one of the biggest reasons I found what my calling was and am following my dreams. If you ever need me for anything, I do mean anything, know that I will be there in a flash.

2. You have taught me so much, and I only wish you the best. I know that things might get rough, but I am always here for you. Please, do not change yourself for anyone. You are great as YOU. You will go and do great things. I will see you soon.
